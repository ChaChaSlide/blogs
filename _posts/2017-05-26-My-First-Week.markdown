#What i learned in the first week:

##I have learned that banging your head against the keyboard out of frustration is 100% acceptable. I have also learned multiple ways to be able to counteract that. We have been taught HTML(EZ!), CSS and have started messing around with bootstrap as a framework for both of those. 

#Why i joined a web dev bootcamp:

##I joined to able to satisfy me need to create and pairing it with my love for computers. My dream job is to be able to sit at a computer all day, disconnected and just make a website or a piece of software for someone.
