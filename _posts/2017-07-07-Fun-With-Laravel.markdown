#Week 7 of bootcamp was more eventful, less frustrating and here's why.
###Laravel
Laravel is a frame-work (a supporting structure) for PHP that makes everyones life 10x easier. It takes all the hard and complex tasks that PHP has and turns them into an easy and fun to use language. We started by taking projects that we already finished with vanilla PHP and implented them into laravel. The main struggle with vanilla PHP is getting all of your tables and data to mesh and correspond together in the way that you want it to. Angular introduces easy to use models, views, routes, controllers etc.. in an extremly easy to follow file architecture. In english, using PHP is like building a house with no blueprint, no conctractors and no expertise. Angular is like building a house with blueprints and expert contractors to help you out along the way. Sounds much easier right? i wish i could post and tell you guys more but as the class grows so does the learning curve and knowledge base.

Thank you for reading,
