Thank you all for continuing to keep up and follow along with me through this bootcamp. This week
we dove into PHP, PHP is a backend database programming language that is used for web development.
The language itself is very easy to understand especially when you realize what it is doing, the implementation
on the other hand is not as easy. PHP takes a database that you create and lets you manipulate the data and connect 
it in any way you want to. The hardest part about PHP in my opinion is how to implement it into a prject that we have already created with out starting from scratch. 


In this weeks project, we were creating a database of colors that we could add to and take away from using a webpage. We were also adding certain colors to individual palettes. we used PHP to create 3 different tables (color_palette, colors and palettes) and connect those so that certain data from colors and palettes would be seen in color_palette. Our instructor has been a professional developer using PHP for years, so trying to troubleshoot while keeping up with her pace of work was extremely hard and i found myself getting stuck in places that i shouldnt have gotten stuck on. I was getting extremely frustrated by the end of the week becuase i felt so behind.


Thank You,
	Cha'Sed Miller.
